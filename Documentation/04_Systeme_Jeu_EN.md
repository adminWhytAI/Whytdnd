# Game System - D&D 5e

## The d20: Heart of the System

### Fundamental Principle

Almost all uncertain actions are resolved with a **d20**:
```
d20 + Modifiers ≥ Difficulty Class (DC)
```

### The Three Types of Rolls

1. **Ability Checks**
2. **Attack Rolls**
3. **Saving Throws**

## Ability Checks

### When to Use

When a character attempts an action with uncertain outcome:
- Climbing a cliff
- Persuading a guard
- Deciphering an ancient text
- Detecting a trap

### Formula

```
d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if applicable) ≥ DC
```

### With or Without Proficiency

**With proficiency** (mastered skill or tool):
- Add **proficiency bonus** (+2 to +6)

**Without proficiency**:
- Only the ability modifier

**Example**:
- Climbing (Strength), level 3, Strength 16 (+3), Athletics proficiency
- Roll: d20 + 3 (Strength) + 2 (proficiency) = d20 + 5

### The 18 Skills

**Strength (STR)**
- Athletics

**Dexterity (DEX)**
- Acrobatics
- Stealth
- Sleight of Hand

**Intelligence (INT)**
- Arcana
- History
- Investigation
- Nature
- Religion

**Wisdom (WIS)**
- Animal Handling
- Insight
- Medicine
- Perception
- Survival

**Charisma (CHA)**
- Intimidation
- Persuasion
- Performance
- Deception

### Passive Checks

Certain situations use **passive values** (no roll):

```
10 + all applicable modifiers
```

**Passive Perception** (most common):
```
10 + Wis modifier + proficiency bonus (if Perception proficient)
```

**Use**:
- DM uses it for discreet comparison
- Detecting ambushes
- Noticing details

## Difficulty Class (DC)

### DC Table

| DC | Difficulty |
|----|------------|
| 5 | Very easy |
| 10 | Easy |
| 15 | Medium |
| 20 | Hard |
| 25 | Very hard |
| 30 | Nearly impossible |

### Common DCs by Task

**Athletics/Acrobatics**:
- Climb rough surface: DC 10
- Climb smooth wall: DC 20
- Jump 3m high: DC 20

**Stealth**:
- Hide: vs Passive Perception
- Move silently: DC 10-15

**Persuasion/Intimidation**:
- Convince friendly person: DC 10
- Convince neutral person: DC 15
- Convince hostile person: DC 20

## Attack Rolls

### Formula

```
d20 + Attack Bonus ≥ Target's Armor Class (AC)
```

### Attack Bonus

**Melee weapons**:
```
Str modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if weapon proficient)
```

**Finesse weapons** (rapier, dagger, etc.):
```
Str OR Dex modifier + Proficiency Bonus
```

**Ranged weapons**:
```
Dex modifier + Proficiency Bonus
```

**Thrown weapons**:
```
Str modifier + Proficiency Bonus (melee or thrown)
```

**Spells**:
```
Spellcasting Ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus
```

### On a Hit

Roll **damage dice** of weapon/spell + modifier

**Example**:
- Longsword: 1d8 + Str modifier
- Fireball: 8d6 (no modifier)

### Critical Hits

**Natural 20** (d20 shows 20):
- Automatically hits
- **Double damage dice** (not modifiers)
- Example: 1d8+3 becomes 2d8+3

**Natural 1** (d20 shows 1):
- Automatic failure

## Saving Throws

### When to Use

When a creature attempts to **resist** an effect:
- Avoiding a spell
- Resisting poison
- Escaping a trap

### Formula

```
d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient) ≥ DC
```

### Spell DC

```
DC = 8 + Proficiency Bonus + Caster's Spellcasting Ability Modifier
```

**Example**:
- Level 5 Wizard, Intelligence 16 (+3)
- Spell DC = 8 + 3 (proficiency) + 3 (Int) = 14

### Result

**Success**: Avoids effect or takes half damage
**Failure**: Takes full effect

## Advantage and Disadvantage

### Advantage

**Roll 2d20, take the better result**

**Situations giving advantage**:
- Attacking an unconscious target
- Attacking an invisible target you can see
- Helping an ally
- Favorable conditions (surprise, ideal terrain, etc.)
- Certain class abilities

### Disadvantage

**Roll 2d20, take the worse result**

**Situations giving disadvantage**:
- Attacking while invisible
- Attacking beyond normal range
- Close combat with ranged weapon
- Unfavorable conditions (darkness, restrained, etc.)

### Important Rule

**Advantage and disadvantage cancel out**:
- Multiple sources of advantage = 1 advantage
- Multiple sources of disadvantage = 1 disadvantage
- If both: normal roll

## Proficiency Bonus

### Progression

| Level | Bonus |
|--------|-------|
| 1-4    | +2    |
| 5-8    | +3    |
| 9-12   | +4    |
| 13-16  | +5    |
| 17-20  | +6    |

### Application

Applies to:
- Ability checks (proficient skills)
- Attack rolls (proficient weapons)
- Saving throws (proficient)
- Spell DC
- Certain class abilities

**Golden rule**: Applies only **once** per roll

### Expertise

Double proficiency bonus for a skill
