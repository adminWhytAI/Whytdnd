"Journal - Day 47

Today, we faced the red dragon. My hands trembled
as I gripped my axe - but not from fear, from ancestral rage. Every
dwarf carries the hatred of dragons in their blood. When the beast fell,
I felt no joy, just... relief. Thorin nearly
died. I should have protected him better.

My father always said: 'A dwarf without his clan is nothing.'
These adventurers are my clan now."
