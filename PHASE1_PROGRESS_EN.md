## Documentation Characteristics

### Adopted Style

**First person**: "I am", "I feel", "I see"
**Immersive**: Lived experience, not technical description
**Emotional**: Feelings, motivations, frustrations
**Contextual**: Relationships, situations, concrete examples
**Authentic**: Adapted language (low INT = simple sentences)

### Typical Structure

1. **Self-perception** (body, senses, abilities)
2. **Worldview** (how I see things)
3. **Emotions and feelings** (what I feel)
4. **Strengths** (what I do well)
5. **Limitations** (my challenges)
6. **Relationships** (with other types)
7. **Motivations** (why I act)
8. **Concrete examples** (lived situations)

### Content Quality

**Depth**: 1,600-2,800 words per file
**Nuances**: Positive AND negative aspects
**Consistency**: Aligned with D&D 5e lore
**Usability**: Directly usable by RAG

## Next Objective

### High Priority (Next 10 files)

**Important races**:
- Being_A_Human.md
- Being_An_Elf_High.md
- Being_A_Halfling_Lightfoot.md

**Popular classes**:
- Being_A_Wizard.md
- Being_A_Rogue.md
- Being_A_Cleric.md

**Critical stats**:
- Having_High_Intelligence.md
- Having_High_Wisdom.md
- Having_High_Charisma.md

**Alignments**:
- Living_Chaotic_Good.md

## Statistics

**Files created**: 5
**Total words**: ~10,800
**Average per file**: ~2,160 words
**Estimated time**: ~3 hours
**Progress**: 11% (5/46)

## Remaining Time Estimate

**At 5 files/session**:
- Remaining sessions: ~8-9
- Total estimated time: 24-27 hours
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks at 2-3h/day

## Intended Use

These files will be:
1. **Parsed** by `immersive_parser.py`
2. **Fragmented** into semantic chunks
3. **Vectorized** with sentence-transformers
4. **Indexed** in ChromaDB (universal database)
5. **Retrieved** dynamically according to created character
6. **Injected** into GGUF prompt

**Result**: The GGUF authentically embodies the character with all their cultural, behavioral, and emotional nuances.

## Examples of Generated Fragments

### Being_A_Dwarf_Mountain.md ‚Üí Fragments

```
Fragment 1 (Identity):
"I am stocky and dense, all muscle and solid bone. 
My beard is my pride. In darkness, I see better 
than these clumsy humans."

Fragment 2 (Culture):
"Honor is not a word for me, it's a chain that binds me. 
My clan is my family extended over centuries."

Fragment 3 (Emotions):
"Orcs? My blood boils just thinking about them. 
This rage is in my bones, passed down by my ancestors."

Fragment 4 (Expression):
"I say what I think. By my ancestors' beards! 
Hard as stone. Forged in fire."
```

### Having_Low_Intelligence.md ‚Üí Fragments

```
Fragment 1 (Thinking):
"I think in a simple and direct way. Big words 
lose me. I understand what I can see, touch, do."

Fragment 2 (Communication):
"My sentences are short. Simple. 'Me not understand.' 
'You explain simple?'"

Fragment 3 (Compensation):
"I may not be smart, but I am loyal. Strong. Brave. 
I protect my friends. Simple. Effective."
```
